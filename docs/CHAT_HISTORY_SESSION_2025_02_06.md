# LIMS System Development Session - February 6, 2025

## Session Overview
Implemented PM review workflow for routing accessioned samples to appropriate queues based on sample type.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. PM Review Workflow Implementation
- Modified Accessioning page to add PM review functionality when toggled to "completed" view
- Implemented automatic routing logic:
  - DNA sample types (DNA, DNA_PLATE, CDNA, etc.) → DNA Quant Queue
  - Other sample types → Extraction Queue
- Added visual indicators showing queue destination for each sample

### 2. Backend Updates
- Updated queue mapping in `/samples/queues/{queue_name}` endpoint:
  - `extraction` queue now maps to `extraction_queue` status
  - Added `dna_quant` queue mapping to `dna_quant_queue` status
- Fixed enum handling issues by converting status column from PostgreSQL enum to VARCHAR
- Added proper validation in SampleUpdate schema

### 3. Created DNA Quant Queue Page
- New page at `/samples/dna-quant-queue`
- Similar interface to Extraction Queue for consistency
- Allows lab managers to assign samples to technicians for quantification

### 4. Frontend Enhancements
- Updated statusOptions and statusColors in Samples page to include new queue statuses
- Added "Queue Destination" column in Accessioning page when viewing completed samples
- Fixed permission checks - added `reviewAndRouteSamples` action for PM role

### 5. Database Migration
- Converted `samples.status` column from enum to VARCHAR to resolve SQLAlchemy enum caching issues
- Added check constraint to ensure valid status values
- Successfully migrated existing data

## Technical Issues Resolved

### Enum Handling Problem
- **Issue**: SQLAlchemy was caching enum values and sending uppercase enum names instead of values
- **Solution**: 
  1. Converted status column from PostgreSQL enum to VARCHAR
  2. Updated Sample model to use String column type
  3. Added proper enum value handling in bulk update endpoint

### Missing Status Values
- **Issue**: Samples disappeared from main page after routing
- **Solution**: Added 'extraction_queue' and 'dna_quant_queue' to statusOptions in Samples.tsx

### Extraction Queue Bug
- **Issue**: Samples weren't showing in extraction queue page
- **Solution**: Fixed ExtractionQueue.tsx to use correct API endpoint `/samples/queues/extraction`

### Missing Client Update Endpoint
- **Issue**: PUT /api/v1/clients/{id} was returning 405 Method Not Allowed
- **Solution**: Added update_client endpoint in clients.py

### Lab Tech Assignment Error
- **Issue**: Foreign key constraint error when assigning samples to extraction
- **Solution**: 
  1. Updated ExtractionQueue to fetch real users from database
  2. Created lab technician users in the system
  3. Fixed dropdown to show actual users instead of mock data

## Current System State

### Sample Workflow
```
Registered → Received → Accessioning → Accessioned → 
[PM Review] → 
  - DNA/DNA Plate samples → DNA Quant Queue → Library Prep
  - Other samples → Extraction Queue → In Extraction → Extracted → DNA Quant Queue
```

### Key Files Modified
1. `/backend/app/api/api_v1/endpoints/samples.py` - Updated bulk-update endpoint
2. `/backend/app/api/api_v1/endpoints/clients.py` - Added PUT endpoint
3. `/backend/app/models/sample.py` - Changed status column to String type
4. `/frontend/src/pages/Accessioning.tsx` - Added PM review logic
5. `/frontend/src/pages/samples/DNAQuantQueue.tsx` - New DNA Quant Queue page
6. `/frontend/src/pages/samples/ExtractionQueue.tsx` - Fixed to use real users
7. `/frontend/src/pages/Samples.tsx` - Added new status options
8. `/frontend/src/config/rolePermissions.ts` - Added PM permissions

### Database Changes
- Converted `samples.status` from enum to VARCHAR(50)
- Added check constraint for valid status values
- Created lab technician users:
  - jsmith (Lab Tech)
  - jdoe (Lab Tech)
  - mjohnson (Lab Manager)
  - swilliams (Lab Tech)
- Current status distribution:
  - DELETED: 117 samples
  - ACCESSIONING: 38 samples  
  - REGISTERED: 17 samples
  - ACCESSIONED: 9 samples
  - extraction_queue: 2 samples

## Next Steps
1. Build Library Prep planning and tracking system
2. Build Sequencing run management system
3. Implement report generation for completed workflows
4. Add email notifications for status changes
5. Enhance dashboard with queue metrics

## Important Notes
- PM role users can now review accessioned samples and route them to appropriate queues
- DNA sample types automatically skip extraction and go directly to quantification
- All status changes are logged with user information and timestamps
- The system maintains full audit trail for CFR Part 11 compliance
- Lab technicians can now be assigned to extraction work through the UI
