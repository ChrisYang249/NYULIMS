# LIMS System - Laboratory Information Management System

## Project Description

A modern, CFR Part 11 compliant Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) designed for managing DNA sequencing workflows in genomics laboratories. Built with FastAPI and React, this system provides end-to-end sample tracking, project management, and sequencing operations with complete audit trails and regulatory compliance.

## Key Features

### üî¨ Sample Management
- **Barcode Generation**: Automatic 6-8 digit barcode generation with support for re-processing (e.g., 123456-R1 for rerun)
- **Sample Tracking**: Complete chain of custody from receipt through delivery
- **Multiple Sample Types**: Support for stool, swab, DNA, RNA, food, milk, and other sample types
- **Workflow States**: Received ‚Üí Accessioned ‚Üí Extracted ‚Üí Library Prepped ‚Üí Sequenced ‚Üí Analyzed ‚Üí Delivered

### üìä Project Management
- **Project Tracking**: Unique project IDs (CP + 5 digits) with client association
- **TAT Management**: Configurable turnaround times (5-7D to 10-12W)
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time project status based on sample progress
- **File Attachments**: Support for quotes and submission forms

### üß™ Laboratory Operations
- **Extraction Planning**: 96-well plate management with 3 control positions
- **Library Prep Planning**: Batch processing across multiple projects
- **Sequencing Run Management**: Track flowcells, reagents, yields, and QC metrics
- **Re-processing Support**: Handle re-extraction, re-prep, and re-sequencing workflows

### üîê Regulatory Compliance (CFR Part 11)
- **Electronic Signatures**: Timestamped approval workflows with reason capture
- **Audit Trails**: Complete tracking of all data changes with before/after values
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions (Super Admin, PM, Accessioner, Lab Tech, Lab Manager, Director, Sales)
- **Password Policies**: Enforced complexity, history, and expiration rules
- **Session Management**: Automatic timeouts and account lockouts

### üìà Analytics & Reporting
- **Dashboard**: Real-time metrics for active projects, samples, and pending work
- **QC Tracking**: Pass/fail rates and resequencing queues
- **Performance Metrics**: TAT adherence and throughput monitoring

## Technical Architecture

### Backend (FastAPI + PostgreSQL)
- **API**: RESTful API with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with role-based access control
- **Audit System**: Automatic change tracking on all database operations

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **UI Framework**: Ant Design components for professional interface
- **State Management**: Zustand for efficient state handling
- **Routing**: React Router with protected routes
- **API Integration**: Axios with automatic auth token handling

### Deployment & Portability
- **Containerization Ready**: Designed for Docker deployment
- **On-Premise**: Suitable for in-house server installation
- **Environment Configuration**: Flexible .env based configuration

## Use Cases

1. **Clinical Genomics Labs**: Managing patient samples through NGS workflows
2. **Research Facilities**: Tracking research samples with full audit compliance
3. **Food Safety Testing**: Managing food and environmental samples
4. **Contract Labs**: Multi-client project management with TAT tracking

## Benefits

- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements for clinical and research labs
- **Efficiency**: Streamline lab operations with automated workflows
- **Traceability**: Complete sample history from receipt to delivery
- **Scalability**: Handle 5000+ samples per month
- **Flexibility**: Adaptable to various sequencing platforms and workflows

## Target Users

- Laboratory Directors
- Project Managers
- Lab Technicians
- Bioinformatics Analysts
- Quality Assurance Teams
- Client Service Representatives

## Future Roadmap

- Instrument integration (sequencers, liquid handlers)
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Client portal for sample submission
- Mobile app for barcode scanning
- Integration with ERP/billing systems
- Automated sequencing run planning
