- **Enhanced Workflow States**: 
  - Registered ‚Üí Received ‚Üí Accessioning ‚Üí Accessioned
  - Accessioned ‚Üí Extraction Queue ‚Üí In Extraction ‚Üí Extracted
  - Extracted ‚Üí DNA Quant Queue ‚Üí Library Prep ‚Üí Sequenced ‚Üí Analyzed ‚Üí Delivered
- **Accessioning System**: 
  - Pre-treatment options (Metapolyzyme, Proteinase K, etc.)
  - Spike-in tracking (Zymo standards)
  - Flag system with abbreviations (LOW_VOL, CONTAM, PROK, etc.)
  - Discrepancy management with PM approval workflow
- **Bulk Operations**: Import samples via CSV/Excel, bulk status updates, bulk deletion
- **Service Type Tracking**: Track specific sequencing service requirements (WGS, 16S V1V3, V3V4, ONT, etc.)
- **Storage Management**: Comprehensive freezer/shelf/box/position tracking with occupancy visualization
- **Activity Timeline**: Complete comment and change history for each sample
- **Smart Sorting**: Samples automatically sorted by due date and project for prioritization

### üìä Project Management

  - Method selection (Qiagen PowerSoil, DNeasy, Zymo, etc.)
  - Well position tracking (A1-H12)
  - QC data capture (concentration, volume, purity ratios)
- **Extraction Planning**: 96-well plate management with 3 control positions
- **Library Prep Planning**: Batch processing across multiple projects
- **Sequencing Run Management**: Track flowcells, reagents, yields, and QC metrics
- **Re-processing Support**: Handle re-extraction, re-prep, and re-sequencing workflows
- **Smart Routing**: DNA/DNA Plate samples skip extraction queue

### üîê Regulatory Compliance (CFR Part 11)
- **Electronic Signatures**: Timestamped approval workflows with reason capture
- **Audit Trails**: Complete tracking of all data changes with before/after values
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions (Super Admin, PM, Accessioner, Lab Tech, Lab Manager, Director, Sales)
- **Password Policies**: Enforced complexity, history, and expiration rules
- **Session Management**: Automatic timeouts and account lockouts

### üìà Analytics & Reporting
- **Dashboard**: Real-time metrics for active projects, samples, and pending work
- **QC Tracking**: Pass/fail rates and resequencing queues
- **Performance Metrics**: TAT adherence and throughput monitoring

## Technical Architecture

- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with role-based access control
- **Audit System**: Automatic change tracking on all database operations

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **UI Framework**: Ant Design components for professional interface
- **State Management**: Zustand for efficient state handling
- **Routing**: React Router with protected routes and URL-based filter persistence
- **API Integration**: Axios with automatic auth token handling
- **Advanced Features**: 
  - Searchable dropdowns with real-time filtering
  - Bulk import with validation preview
  - CSV/Excel template generation
  - Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl+Click for new tab)
  - Persistent filter states across navigation

### Deployment & Portability
- **Containerization Ready**: Designed for Docker deployment
- **On-Premise**: Suitable for in-house server installation
- **Environment Configuration**: Flexible .env based configuration

## Use Cases

1. **Clinical Genomics Labs**: Managing patient samples through NGS workflows
2. **Research Facilities**: Tracking research samples with full audit compliance
3. **Food Safety Testing**: Managing food and environmental samples
4. **Contract Labs**: Multi-client project management with TAT tracking

## Benefits
